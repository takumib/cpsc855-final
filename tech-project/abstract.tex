In this paper we present a flexible means of specifying and verifying the correctness of software for embedded network systems. Our approach uses RESOLVE, an imperative, component based programming and mathematical specification language, to verify the functional correctness of embedded applications. In doing so, we enrich the work originally presented in \cite{regula:2010} with the following: A model view controller (MVC) based implementation of a RESOLVE to C translator, a dynamic memory allocation scheme tailored towards embedded systems running the code generated by our tool, and the addition of a new language keyword that enables users to pair custom RESOLVE specifications with `externally' implemented (non-native RESOLVE) realizations. We demonstrate these additions on an LED (Light emitting diode) driver that showcases recent mathematical developments, as well as formal verification of a toggling capability enhancement.
